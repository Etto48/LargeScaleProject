\chapter{Dataset and Web Scraping}
To populate our data, we did both web scraping and random data generation.
\section{Data Scraping}
The two sources for the scraping are the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{MetaCritic}
	\item \textbf{MobyGames}
\end{itemize}
From the first we retrieved most of the reviews and usernames of our database.
In particular, we retrieved the score, date, author name, text, and the name of the game reviewed.
From the second one, we retrieved all of the information concerning videogames.
We kept the most important attributes, such as Name, Genre, Release Date etc. and we discarded
some MobyGames-specific attributes that were not relevant in our use case.

\section{Data Generation}

Some games that we found on MobyGames were not present on MetaCritic, so we randomly generated some reviews and users to associate to those games.
We also randomly generated all comments found on all reviews, since none could be found on MetaCritic's reviews.
To do so, we used Python algorithms.

\section{Resulting Dataset}
The final volume wanders around 400 MB, which are the result of:
\begin{itemize}
	\item 70k videogames
	\item 250k reviews 
	\item 625k comments
\end{itemize}
