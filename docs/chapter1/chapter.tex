GameCritic is a social-network application that allows its users to share their opinion about videogames.
Among other features, regular users can review games and comment on other users' reviews, while companies that developed or produced
a game can run various analytics on it.

The source code for the application is available at \url{https://github.com/Etto48/LargeScaleProject.git}
